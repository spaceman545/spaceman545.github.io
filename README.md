## Welcome to Spaceman's Comsic Emporium

Feel free to use the [restroom](https://github.com/spaceman545/spaceman545.github.io/edit/main/README.md) before we continue; you may be here a while.

This is my bazaar, of sorts. Look around. Explore what I have to offer. The price for what you watch or read is simply your time. Give me your presence and I will return it with knowledge. 

### Genesis

And God said, “Let there be light” and there was light. God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
